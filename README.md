 A production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation system that understands document structure. Built for large document collections with complex hierarchies (legal, technical, medical, academic).
#### 2.5) Document Hierarchy Understanding, Agentic AI variant 
 A production-ready multi-agent RAG system that uses specialized AI agents to collaboratively answer questions about hierarchical documents.

### 3) Conversational RAG with Persistent Memory
 Production-ready conversational RAG with persistent memory, supporting both **Claude** and **Gemini** as LLM backends.
