# retrieval-augmented-generation                                                      
End-to-end RAG system implementations covering document ingestion, embedding, retrieval strategies, and LLM integration.

### 1) Self Correcting Research Assistant 
 An intelligent AI agent that searches the web, cross-references sources, detects contradictions, and automatically re-verifies disputed facts using the Anthropic Claude API.

### 2) Document Hierarchy Understanding
 A production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation system that understands document structure. Built for large document collections with complex hierarchies (legal, technical, medical, academic).
#### 2.5) Document Hierarchy Understanding, Agentic AI variant 
 A multi-agent RAG system that uses specialized AI agents to collaboratively answer questions about hierarchical documents.

### 3) Conversational RAG with Persistent Memory
 A conversational RAG with persistent memory, supporting both **Claude** and **Gemini** as LLM backends.

### 4) Hybrid Search RAG
 A comprehenzive hybrid search RAG combining **Vector Search**, **BM25**, **Knowledge Graphs**, and **ML Fusion**, while utilizing a React front end. 

### 5) Code Repository RAG
 Intelligent Q&A over codebases with AST-aware analysis, dependency graphs, and multi-file code tracing.

### 6) Multi Modal RAG System
 A unified RAG system that handles text, images, PDFs, and tables together with cross-modal search.

### 7) Real Time Streaming RAG
 RAG over continuously updating data with **incremental indexing**, **time-weighted retrieval**, **deduplication**, and **freshness-aware answers**.
